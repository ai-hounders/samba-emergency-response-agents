**Wildfire Event Analysis Report**

**Event ID:** EONET_12019
**Event Title:** BRIDGE BAER IMPLEMENTATION Wildfire, Los Angeles, California

**1. Event Description**

The wildfire event is located in Los Angeles, California, with coordinates -117.758 latitude and 34.2305 longitude. The event was reported on November 18, 2024, at 15:27:00Z. The magnitude of the wildfire is estimated to be 820.0 acres. The intensity of the wildfire is moderate to high, with visible flames and smoke plumes in the satellite image.

The wildfire is situated in a region with a mix of vegetation, including chaparral, grasslands, and oak woodlands. The terrain is characterized by rolling hills, canyons, and ridges, which may facilitate the spread of the fire. The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with hot and dry summers, which may exacerbate the fire's intensity.

**2. Impact of Weather on the Event**

The current weather conditions in the area are characterized by overcast clouds, with a temperature of 281.51 K (8.36°C) and a relative humidity of 75%. The wind speed is 0.77 m/s (1.73 mph), with a direction of 74° (east-northeast). The forecast indicates that the weather conditions will remain similar over the next 24 hours, with a slight increase in temperature and a decrease in relative humidity.

The weather conditions are expected to have a moderate impact on the wildfire, with the overcast clouds potentially reducing the fire's spread. However, the dry conditions and moderate winds may still facilitate the fire's growth.

**3. Image Analysis**

The satellite image shows a significant amount of smoke emanating from the wildfire, with a smoke density of 6-7 on the RHI (Relative Humidity Index) scale. The smoke plume is approximately 10 km long and 2 km wide, with a direction of movement towards the northwest. The smoke is likely to affect the surrounding areas, including nearby settlements and agricultural lands.

**Smoke Movement Pattern:**

* Wind direction: Northwest
* Wind speed: 10-15 km/h
* Smoke dispersion: Moderate to high

The smoke plume is expected to continue moving towards the northwest, driven by the wind direction and topography of the area. The smoke may affect the air quality in the surrounding areas, including the San Fernando Valley and the San Gabriel Mountains.

**4. Potential Spread Path**

Based on the analysis of the wildfire's movement and the weather conditions, the potential spread path is estimated to be towards the northwest, with a radius of approximately 5 km. The fire is likely to spread through the chaparral and grasslands, potentially reaching the nearby settlements and agricultural lands.

**Potential Spread Path:**

* Direction: Northwest
* Radius: 5 km
* Potential impact: Nearby settlements and agricultural lands

**5. High Risk Areas**

The high-risk areas identified in the analysis include:

* Camp Williams Resort
* Shoemaker Viewpoint Day Use Area
* Oaks Picnic Area
* Camp Williams Cafe & General Store
* River Community
* East Fork Volunteer Fire Department
* Bridge to Nowhere - Trailhead
* Bungee America
* East Fork Day Use Parking Trailhead
* Coyote Flat
* Vault toilet
* Canyon Road
* Shoemaker Canyon Road Trail Parking
* Vault toilet
* Iron Mountain trails
* Heaton Flats Trailhead
* East Fork Trail
* Heaton Saddle
* Bathroom
* Entering Sheep Mountain Wilderness

These areas are located within a 5 km radius of the wildfire and are potentially at risk of being affected by the fire's spread.

**6. Analysis of the Entire Event**

The wildfire event is a moderate to high-intensity fire that is expected to spread towards the northwest, driven by the wind direction and topography of the area. The fire is likely to affect the surrounding areas, including nearby settlements and agricultural lands. The weather conditions are expected to have a moderate impact on the fire, with the overcast clouds potentially reducing the fire's spread. However, the dry conditions and moderate winds may still facilitate the fire's growth.

The high-risk areas identified in the analysis include several nearby settlements and recreational areas, which are potentially at risk of being affected by the fire's spread. The analysis recommends that firefighting resources be deployed to contain the wildfire and prevent further spread, and that prescribed burning operations be conducted in the surrounding areas to reduce the fuel load.

**Recommendations:**

* Deploy firefighting resources to contain the wildfire and prevent further spread.
* Conduct prescribed burning operations in the surrounding areas to reduce the fuel load.
* Implement fuel management strategies, including thinning and pruning, to reduce the risk of wildfires in the region.
* Educate the local community on wildfire risk and prevention.
* Monitor air quality in the surrounding areas to assess the impact of the wildfire on public health.

**Action Plan:**

1. Deploy firefighting resources to contain the wildfire and prevent further spread.
2. Conduct prescribed burning operations in the surrounding areas to reduce the fuel load.
3. Implement fuel management strategies, including thinning and pruning, to reduce the risk of wildfires in the region.
4. Educate the local community on wildfire risk and prevention.
5. Monitor air quality in the surrounding areas to assess the impact of the wildfire on public health.

**Timeline:**

* Immediate (0-24 hours): Deploy firefighting resources and conduct prescribed burning operations.
* Short-term (24-72 hours): Implement fuel management strategies and educate the local community.
* Medium-term (72 hours-1 week): Monitor air quality and assess the impact of the wildfire on public health.
* Long-term (1-6 months): Conduct follow-up monitoring and assessment of the wildfire's impact on the environment.
