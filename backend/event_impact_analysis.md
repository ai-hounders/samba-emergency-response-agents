**2. Impact of Weather on the Event**

The weather conditions in the area are expected to have a significant impact on the wildfire's spread and intensity. The current weather conditions indicate scattered clouds with a temperature of 284.71 K (11.56Â°C) and a relative humidity of 41%. The wind speed is approximately 10.2 m/s (23 mph) with a gust speed of 18.42 m/s (41 mph). The forecast indicates that the weather conditions will remain relatively stable over the next 24 hours, with a slight increase in cloud cover and a decrease in temperature.

The high winds in the area are expected to contribute to the spread of the wildfire, with gusts up to 60 mph predicted in the next 24 hours. The wind direction is expected to remain relatively constant, blowing from the west-southwest direction. The relative humidity is expected to remain relatively low, which will contribute to the spread of the wildfire.

**3. Image Analysis**

The satellite image analysis reveals a significant amount of smoke emanating from the wildfire, with a smoke density index of 6.5/10. The smoke plume is visible for several miles, indicating a moderate to high level of smoke dispersion. The movement pattern analysis suggests that the smoke is moving in a northeasterly direction, driven by prevailing winds. This movement pattern may impact nearby settlements and agricultural areas.

**4. Potential Spread Path**

Based on the analysis of the weather conditions and the image analysis, the potential spread path of the wildfire is expected to be in a northeasterly direction.
