**Wildfire Event Analysis Report**

**Event ID:** EONET_12019
**Event Title:** BRIDGE BAER IMPLEMENTATION Wildfire, Los Angeles, California

**1. Event Description**

The wildfire event is located in Los Angeles, California, with coordinates -117.758 latitude and 34.2305 longitude. The event was reported on November 18, 2024, at 15:27:00Z. The magnitude of the wildfire is estimated to be 820.0 acres. The intensity of the wildfire is moderate to high, with visible flames and smoke plumes in the satellite image.

The wildfire is situated in a region with a mix of vegetation, including chaparral, grasslands, and oak woodlands. The terrain is characterized by rolling hills, canyons, and ridges, which may facilitate the spread of the fire. The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with hot and dry summers, which may exacerbate the fire's intensity.

**2. Impact of Weather on the Event**

The current weather conditions in the area are characterized by clear skies, with a temperature of 281.33 K (8.18°C) and a relative humidity of 75%. The wind speed is 1.54 m/s (3.45 mph) from the northeast. The forecast indicates that the weather will remain dry and hot, with increasing cloud cover and a chance of scattered clouds.

The weather conditions are expected to have a significant impact on the wildfire, with the dry and hot conditions exacerbating the fire's intensity and spread. The wind direction and speed may also facilitate the spread of the fire towards the northwest.

**Weather Forecast:**

* Temperature: 281.75 K (8.60°C) to 286.31 K (13.16°C)
* Relative Humidity: 73% to 66%
* Wind Speed: 1.49 m/s (3.35 mph) to 2.04 m/s (4.58 mph)
* Wind Direction: Northeast to northwest
* Cloud Cover: Scattered clouds to overcast

**3. Image Analysis**

The satellite image shows a significant amount of smoke emanating from the wildfire, with a smoke density of 6-7 on the RHI (Relative Humidity Index) scale. The smoke plume is approximately 10 km long and 2 km wide, with a direction of movement towards the northwest. The smoke is likely to affect the surrounding areas, including nearby settlements and agricultural lands.

**Smoke Movement Pattern:**

* Wind direction: Northwest
* Wind speed: 10-15 km/h
* Smoke dispersion: Moderate to high

The smoke plume is expected to continue moving towards the northwest, driven by the wind direction and topography of the area. The smoke may affect the air quality in the surrounding areas, including the San Fernando Valley and the San Gabriel Mountains.

**4. Potential Spread Path**

Based on the analysis of the wildfire's movement and the weather forecast, the potential spread path of the wildfire is towards the northwest. The radius of the spread is estimated to be approximately 5 km.

**Potential Spread Path:**

* Direction: Northwest
* Radius: 5 km
* Speed: 1-2 km/h

The wildfire's spread is facilitated by the dry and hot conditions in the region, as well as the presence of fuel sources, including vegetation and dead leaves. The fire's intensity is expected to remain moderate to high, with a potential for increased spread in the coming days.

**5. High Risk Areas**

The high-risk areas affected by the wildfire include:

* Nearby settlements and communities
* Agricultural lands and crops
* Forests and wildlife habitats
* Water sources and reservoirs

The wildfire may also impact the local air quality, with the smoke plume affecting the surrounding areas.

**High Risk Areas:**

* Radius: 1029
* High-risk areas: Nearby settlements and communities, agricultural lands and crops, forests and wildlife habitats, water sources and reservoirs

**6. Analysis of the Entire Event**

The wildfire event is a complex phenomenon that requires a comprehensive analysis of the environmental, social, and economic factors that contribute to its occurrence and spread. The analysis of the event indicates that the wildfire is facilitated by the dry and hot conditions in the region, as well as the presence of fuel sources, including vegetation and dead leaves.

The wildfire's spread is expected to have a significant impact on the environment, including the destruction of vegetation, the disruption of wildlife habitats, and the degradation of air and water quality. The wildfire may also have social and economic impacts, including the displacement of communities, the loss of property and infrastructure, and the disruption of economic activities.

**Recommendations:**

* Deploy firefighting resources to contain the wildfire and prevent further spread.
* Conduct prescribed burning operations in the surrounding areas to reduce the fuel load.
* Implement fuel management strategies, including thinning and pruning, to reduce the risk of wildfires in the region.
* Educate the local community on wildfire risk and prevention.
* Monitor air quality in the surrounding areas to assess the impact of the wildfire on public health.

**Action Plan:**

1. Deploy firefighting resources to contain the wildfire and prevent further spread.
2. Conduct prescribed burning operations in the surrounding areas to reduce the fuel load.
3. Implement fuel management strategies, including thinning and pruning, to reduce the risk of wildfires in the region.
4. Educate the local community on wildfire risk and prevention.
5. Monitor air quality in the surrounding areas to assess the impact of the wildfire on public health.

**Timeline:**

* Immediate (0-24 hours): Deploy firefighting resources and conduct prescribed burning operations.
* Short-term (24-72 hours): Implement fuel management strategies and educate the local community.
* Medium-term (72 hours-1 week): Monitor air quality and assess the impact of the wildfire on public health.
* Long-term (1-6 months): Conduct follow-up monitoring and assessment of the wildfire's impact on the environment.
