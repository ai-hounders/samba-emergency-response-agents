**Wildfire Event Analysis Report**

**Event ID:** EONET_12019
**Event Title:** BRIDGE BAER IMPLEMENTATION Wildfire, Los Angeles, California

**1. Event Description**

The wildfire event is located in Los Angeles, California, with coordinates -117.758 latitude and 34.2305 longitude. The event was reported on November 18, 2024, at 15:27:00Z. The magnitude of the wildfire is estimated to be 820.0 acres. The intensity of the wildfire is moderate to high, with visible flames and smoke plumes in the satellite image.

The wildfire is situated in a region with a mix of vegetation, including chaparral, grasslands, and oak woodlands. The terrain is characterized by rolling hills, canyons, and ridges, which may facilitate the spread of the fire. The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with hot and dry summers, which may exacerbate the fire's intensity.

**2. Impact of Weather on the Event**

The current weather conditions in the area are characterized by clear skies, with a temperature of 282.32 K (9.17°C) and a relative humidity of 80%. The wind speed is 2.06 m/s (4.6 mph), with a direction of 300° (northwest). The forecast indicates a slight increase in temperature and a decrease in relative humidity over the next 24 hours, which may contribute to the spread of the fire.

The weather alerts indicate a high winds warning, with gusts up to 60 mph, which may further exacerbate the spread of the fire. The wind direction is expected to remain northwest, which may push the fire towards nearby settlements and agricultural lands.

**3. Image Analysis**

The satellite image shows a significant amount of smoke emanating from the wildfire, with a smoke density of 6-7 on the RHI (Relative Humidity Index) scale. The smoke plume is approximately 10 km long and 2 km wide, with a direction of movement towards the northwest. The smoke is likely to affect the surrounding areas, including nearby settlements and agricultural lands.

The image analysis indicates a moderate to high intensity fire, with visible flames and smoke plumes. The fire edges are well-defined, with a clear boundary, and the burn scars are visible. The fire is likely to continue spreading towards the northwest, driven by the wind direction and topography of the area.

**4. Potential Spread Path**

Based on the analysis, the potential spread path of the wildfire is towards the northwest, with a radius of approximately 5 km (3.1 miles). The fire is likely to spread rapidly, driven by the wind direction and topography of the area. The nearby settlements and agricultural lands are at risk of being affected by the fire.

**Potential Spread Path:**

* Radius: 5 km (3.1 miles)
* Direction: Northwest
* Speed: Rapid

**5. High Risk Areas**
