**Wildfire Event Analysis Report**

**Event ID:** EONET_12044
**Event Title:** B ANAYA Wildfire, Santa Fe, New Mexico

**1. Event Description**

The B ANAYA Wildfire is located north of Moriarty, New Mexico, and east of SR 41, south of Stanley, NM. According to the provided event details, the wildfire has affected an area of approximately 795 acres as of November 24, 2024, at 17:30:00Z. The intensity of the wildfire is not explicitly stated, but the affected area suggests a moderate to high level of severity.

**2. Impact of Weather on the Event**

The current weather conditions in the area are characterized by scattered clouds with a temperature of 284.71 K (11.56Â°C) and a relative humidity of 42%. The wind speed is moderate, at 10.2 m/s (23 mph), with gusts up to 18.42 m/s (41 mph). The forecast indicates that the weather will remain mostly cloudy with a high chance of overcast conditions, which may contribute to the spread of the wildfire. The wind direction is expected to remain relatively constant, blowing from the southwest, which may also contribute to the spread of the fire.

The High Winds Warning issued by the Simulated Alert System indicates that strong winds are expected in the area, with gusts up to 60 mph. This may significantly impact the spread of the wildfire, making it more challenging to contain.

**3. Image Analysis**

Based on the satellite image analysis, the smoke density appears to be moderate, with a visible plume extending northeast from the fire location. The smoke movement pattern suggests a prevailing wind direction from the southwest, which may be contributing to the spread of the fire. The smoke density is not extremely high, indicating that the fire may not be producing a large amount of particulate matter at this time. However, continued monitoring is necessary to assess any changes in smoke density and movement patterns.

**4. Potential Spread Path**

Based on the analysis of the wildfire's current spread pattern and the forecasted weather conditions, the potential spread path is estimated to be in a northeast direction, with a radius of approximately 5-10 miles (8-16 kilometers) in the next 24-48 hours. This estimate takes into account the current rate of spread, wind direction, and the potential for increased fire activity due to the forecasted weather conditions.

The B ANAYA Wildfire is a moderate to high-severity wildfire that has affected approximately 795 acres in the Moriarty, New Mexico area. The current weather conditions, including scattered clouds and moderate winds, may contribute to the spread of the fire. The forecasted weather conditions, including overcast conditions and strong winds, may also impact the spread of the fire. The potential spread path is estimated to be in a northeast direction, with a radius of approximately 5-10 miles (8-16 kilometers) in the next 24-48 hours.

The high-risk areas identified include several schools, gas stations, and residential areas. The wildfire may have a significant impact on local wildlife, particularly if the fire spreads rapidly or is not contained. Nearby settlements, including Moriarty and Stanley, may also be affected by the wildfire, particularly if the fire spreads in a southerly direction. Air quality may also be impacted, particularly for residents in nearby communities.

Recommendations for further monitoring or intervention include:

* Continued monitoring of the wildfire using satellite imagery and ground-based observations to assess changes in fire spread, smoke density, and environmental impact.
* Implementation of fire management strategies, including containment and suppression efforts, to minimize the spread of the wildfire and protect nearby settlements and natural resources.
* Coordination with local authorities and emergency management officials to ensure public safety and provide timely updates on the status of the wildfire.
* Consideration of air quality monitoring in nearby communities to assess potential impacts on public health.
* Development of a contingency plan for potential escalation of the wildfire, including evacuation procedures and emergency response protocols.
